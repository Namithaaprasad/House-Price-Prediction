Linear regression model to predict house prices

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The dataset contains various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and furnishing status. The data was first cleaned and preprocessed, including encoding categorical variables, removing multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), and scaling the features using StandardScaler. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, a linear regression model was trained to learn the relationship between the features and house prices. The model was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score, providing insights into how different factors impact the price of a house.
